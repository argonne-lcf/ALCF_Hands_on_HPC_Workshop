# Combining HPC Simulations with AI/ML

Led by Riccardo Balin, assisted by Saumil Patel, Shivam Barwey, Filippo Simini, and Bethany Lusch of ALCF. 

Today, we're learning about coupling simulations and machine learning.
First, [here](Background.md) we will talk about why we would want to couple simulations & ML and describe different approaches to do it.
Then, we will learn about the SmartSim library and how to use it to perform online training and inference of ML models from a CFD simulation [here](NekRS-ML/README.md). 

Bonus:
For extra tips for using the Python and Numpy C APIs, check out [this page](Tips.md).
