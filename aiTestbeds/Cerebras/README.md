## Connection to a CS-2 node

Connection to one of the CS-2 cluster login nodes requires an MFA passcode for authentication - either an 8-digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (e.g. MobilePASS+) or a CRYPTOCard-generated passcode prefixed by a 4-digit pin. This is the same passcode used to authenticate into other ALCF systems, such as Theta and Cooley.

To connect to a CS-2 login, ssh to login nodes:
```bash
ssh ALCFUserID@cerebras.ai.alcf.anl.gov
```

## Job Queuing and Submission

The CS-2 cluster has its own Kubernetes-based system for job submission and queuing. Jobs are started automatically through the Python scripts. 

Use Cerebras cluster command line tool to get addional information about the jobs.

* Jobs that have not yet completed can be listed as
    `(venv_pt) $ csctl get jobs`
* Jobs can be canceled as shown:
    `(venv_pt) $ csctl cancel job wsjob-eyjapwgnycahq9tus4w7id`

See `csctl -h` for more options.
