# Hands-On with AI Testbeds at ALCF 

Scientific applications are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to advance science. Specialized hardware accelerators are designed and built to efficiently run AI applications. With the diverse hardware and software stacks of these systems, it is challenging to comprehend their capabilities, programming approaches, and measure performance. 

We present an overview of novel AI accelerators, namely Cerebras, SambaNova, Graphcore, and Groq. We provide steps on how to program these systems by porting deep learning models with any refactoring of codes implemented in standard DL framework implementations, compiling, and running on the accelerator hardware. The hands-on session enables attendees to understand the key capabilities of emerging AI accelerators and their performance implications for scientific applications.

* **Time:** October 8, 2025
  * 1 - 2 PM: ALCF AI Testbeds
* **Location:** Room 1501
