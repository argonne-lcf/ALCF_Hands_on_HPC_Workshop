# ALCF Hands-on HPC Workshop
### October 29 - 31, 2024
### Agenda: https://www.alcf.anl.gov/events/2024-alcf-hands-hpc-workshop

The ALCF is hosting an in-person Hands-on HPC Workshop on October 29--31, 2024, at the TCS Conference Center at Argonne National Laboratory.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for hands-on time on Polaris and AI Testbeds focusing on porting applications to heterogeneous architectures (CPU + GPU), improving code performance, and exploring AI/ML applications development on ALCF systems.
