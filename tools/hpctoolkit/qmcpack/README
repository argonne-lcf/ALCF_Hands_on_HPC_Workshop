Description:

  This directory contains a hands-on example where you will use HPCToolkit
  to measure and analyze the performance of a prebuilt benchmark that is
  part of QMCPACK - a sophisticated quantum Monte Carlo materials code
  that was developed as part of the Exascale Computing Project. This is
  a non-trivial example. The execution will use 12 MPI ranks and 12 GPU
  tiles, read an input file of roughly 8GB in size and produce two output
  files that are roughly 2GB each.

Contents:

  Makefile 
    a makefile used to collect, analyze, and view performance measurements of
    qmcpack using HPCToolkit's utilities: hpcrun, hpcstruct, hpcprof, and
    hpcviewer

  measure_qmcpack.sh
    a script invoked by the Makefile to measure an execution of qmcpack on a
    node of Aurora

Directions:
  0. If you haven't done this already, cd to the parent directory and source sourceme-aurora.sh
  1. Run "make" with no arguments to learn how to use the Makefile commands to measure,
     analyze, and view profiles and traces for qmcpack 

Notes:
  1. Using hpcrun to measure an execution of qmcpack will take about 2.5 minutes.
  2. Running hpcstruct to analyze the 1.8GB of binaries measured in the execution of qmcpack
     will take ~20s with HPCTOOLKIT_HPCSTRUCT_CACHE pointed at a warm structure cache (as
     directed by item 0 above).
  3. Running hpcprof to integrate measurements + binary analysis results will take about 1.5m
