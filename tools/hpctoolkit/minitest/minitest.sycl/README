This directory contains a small MPI program. Each MPI rank offloads
a computation on a GPU tile using SYCL.

Type 'make' for information about how to build the program, measure
its performance, analyze resulting measurements, and view the 
results.

For suggestions about how to explore the data, see the README file
in ../minitest.omp
