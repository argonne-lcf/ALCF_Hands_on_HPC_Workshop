This directory contains a small MPI program. Each MPI rank offloads
a computation on a GPU tile using SYCL.

Type 'make' for information about how to build the program, measure
its performance, analyze resulting measurements, and view the 
results.

This example uses a preview of HPCToolkit's PC sampling support
for performing instruction-level performance measurement of GPU
kernels using sampling.

The rightmost columns show GINS (GPU instruction count) and GPU_STL:ANY a
measure of GPU instruction stalls collected using hardware support for PC
sampling. Hidden are a collection of stall reasons. You can reveal these
hidden columns using the column chooser. Any column that is grey-ed out
means that there were no measurements recorded for this metric.

During hpcprof then takes the counts for each machine instruction or
stall and maps them back to source code lines, letting you know how many
instruction instances executed on behalf of each source code line.
