This directory contains a small MPI program. Each MPI rank offloads
a computation on a GPU tile using SYCL.

Type 'make' for information about how to build the program, measure
its performance, analyze resulting measurements, and view the
results.

This example uses Intel's GTPin to instrument GPU binaries used by
the code to do instruction counting. The instrumentation adds a
counter to each basic block. At runtime, the counter for a basic
block is incremented each time the block is entered. When hpcrun
finalizes measurements, it takes the count for a basic block and
propagates it to each instruction in the basic block.
(Each instruction in the basic block is executed the same number
of times the block is entered.)

During hpcprof then takes the counts for each machine instruction
and maps them back to source code lines, letting you know how many
instruction instances executed on behalf of each source code line.

NOTE: A shortcoming in Intel's Level Zero runtime may cause
differences between GPU binaries across MPI ranks. This can cause
measurements within GPU kernels to be separate per rank rather
than all summed together. This example uses two ranks and you
may see two copies of the kernel being launched, one per rank.
