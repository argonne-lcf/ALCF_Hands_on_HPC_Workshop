This hands-on session is meant to be done on Aurora.

To get a compute node for the hands-on session, execute the command below on the login node:

source sourceme-get-compute-node.sh  

Once you are on a compute node, load the hpctoolkit module with the following command

source sourceme-on-compute-node.sh


The hands-on examples are in the directories below

hpcstruct - measuring hpctoolkit's hpcstruct multithreaded binary analysis tool
minitest - a set of small examples 

  standard measurement with profiling and tracing:
    minitest.omp - a small test program that offloads a kernel three times with OpenMP 
    minitest.sycl - a small test program that offloads a kernel three times with sycl 

  instruction-level measurement within kernels using binary instrumentation:
    minitest.sycl.gtpin - a small test program that offloads a kernel three times with sycl 

  instruction-level measurement within kernels using hardware-based instruction sampling:
    minitest.sycl.pc - a small test program that offloads a kernel three times with sycl
