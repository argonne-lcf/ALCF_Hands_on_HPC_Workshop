# Agentic Workflows at ALCF

## Overview

Agentic workflows are intelligent computational pipelines that use AI agents to coordinate and execute tasks, make real-time decisions based on user inputs or intermediate results, and adapt to changing conditions.
These workflows can:

* Reason about computational problems using large language models (LLMs)
* Respond to user inputs and prompts
* Dynamically adjust parameters based on intermediate results
* Orchestrate single or multi-system workflows across different computing resources
* Handle errors and retries intelligently
* Generate reports and insights from computational results
* Generate and test new code and agents on-the-fly to meet the workflow goals

This repository contains information on running agentic workflows at ALCF prepared for the 2025 Hands-On Workshop.
Please refer to the [slides](2025HandsOnWorkshop_agenticWorkflows.pdf) for more information on these workflows, how to run them on ALCF resources, and an example for how they can be useful to science applications.
