# Pre-Workshop Materials

These materials include an introduction to machine learning techniques through Jupyter Notebooks. It will be assumed that attendees are already familiar with some of these methods and frameworks before attending.

# Getting Started

Do the following before you come to the tutorial:
*  You need a Google Account to use Colaboratory
*  Goto [Google's Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com) 
*  You should see this page
![start_page](00_pre_workshop_materials/README_imgs/colab_start_page.png)
*  Click on the `New Python Notebook` 
*  Now you will see a new notebook where you can type in python code.

*  After you enter code, type `<shift>+<enter>` to execute the code cell.
*  A full introduction to the notebook environment is out of scope for this tutorial, but many can be found with a [simple google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=jupyter+notebook+tutorial)
*  We will be using notebooks from this repository during the tutorial, so  you should be familiar with how to import them into Colaboratory
*  Now you can open the `File` menu at the top left and select `Open Notebook` which will open a dialogue box.
*  Select the `GitHub` tab in the dialogue box.
*  From here you can enter the url for the github repo: `https://github.com/argonne-lcf/sdl_ai_workshop` and hit `<enter>`.

*  This will show you a list of the Notebooks available in the repo.
*  Select the `introduction.ipynb` file to open and work through it.
*  As each session of the tutorial begins, you will simply select the corresponding notebook from this list and it will create a copy for you in your Colaboratory account (all `*.ipynb` files in the Colaboratory account will be stored in your Google Drive).
* To use a GPU, in the notbook the select `Runtime` -> `Change Runtime Type` and you have a dropbox list of hardward settings to choose from where the notebook can run.
