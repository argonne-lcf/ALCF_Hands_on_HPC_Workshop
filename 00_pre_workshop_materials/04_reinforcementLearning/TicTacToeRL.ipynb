    "We are looking to train a neural network to predict the value of making a move in our Tic Tac Toe board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will be simple with one hidden layer. Our input will encode the current state of the board including who's turn it is. This is arranged as a flat input with the following binary features: location of Xs, location of Os, empty locations, and one value to represent whose turn it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model outputs a prediction for the maximum possible reward expected at the end of the game given the action inside the current board state. This model represents our `V(s)` and is typically called the 'Policy' because it encompasses the movement policy of our players.\n",
